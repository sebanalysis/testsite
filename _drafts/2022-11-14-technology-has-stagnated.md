Infrastructure projects have been slowing down. Stripe founder, Patrick Collision lists a number of jarring examples, comparing those pre-1970 and post-1970.

## Michael Bhaskar - Human Frontiers

> …society has become more hostile to radical innovation, risk-averse, fractious, short-termist. Entrenched interests, a supercharged financialism, swollen bureaucracies, resurgent populisms: all inhibit the most daring forms of new thinking. Raised as we are on a diet of techno-boosterism, this often comes as a surprise. Nonetheless we have built a cautious and unimaginative world.

Lack of unfettered research in Bell Labs:
>One senior Bell Labs researcher, Andrew Odlyzko, making sense of what was happening to his institution over the 1980s and 1990s, called it ‘the decline of unfettered research’.6 The image is significant – society was placing institutional chains around the curiosity-driven research agenda that enabled people like Claude Shannon to explore information theory. Research had been commodified into narrow, directed chunks. Bell had changed; ‘rational’ economic decision making was in. Writing in 1995, Odlyzko had already seen the writing was on the wall for the industrial labs that had nurtured his career: ‘the prospects for a return to unfettered research in the near future are slim. The trend is towards concentration on narrow market segments.’ 7

> Research from MIT shows that while companies still invest in innovation, the focus is on practical applications rather than basic science.8 In essence they piled more into R&D, but forgot the R in favour of the D. Only around 7 per cent of corporate R&D is spent on basic research and 16 per cent on applied research – the rest is all development.

>This all has real consequences: the decline of the corporate research lab has meant science is removed from the economic front line. Even if you take the more positive spin on all of the above – that corporates have simply outsourced research to universities and startups – materially fewer innovative products and processes are created.18
>Society itself is stuck, working against radical ideas. Despite the boosterish pronouncements of Silicon Valley gurus, we are hostile to breakthroughs, more conservative, cautious, rule-bound, anti-maverick, return-oriented, ideologically blinkered and short-sighted than we might think. There are no easy answers to the question of how this could change, which is why the social context weighs so heavily on the future, compounding the Idea Paradox.
>Bell isn't unique. Rather it's emblematic of a shrinking of corporate horizons back to the bottom line: a warning of societal changes that are stifling our capacity for big thinking.

Excessive Financialisation:

> Around 1980 capitalism changed. Building on the work of Austrian School economists (of course), a series of reforms coupled with changes in corporate thinking made markets more open and deregulated, their mechanisms absolute. A new model of shareholder value gained precedence. 
> 
>  In the early 1990s Boeing changed its corporate mission from building aeroplanes to delivering shareholder value (which, it should be added, promptly tanked). Should we be surprised at the subsequent lack of breakthroughs in aviation?

>One key change, exemplified by Boeing's nineties shift, was in ownership, which was increasingly dominated by what two researchers call ‘gray capital’: pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds . . . Eighty per cent of US stock is held by such institutions, more in the UK. Ownership of the firms driving large-scale innovation is hence diffuse, devolved to a cadre of professional asset managers removed from immediate responsibility, lacking a clear vision or leadership and relentlessly focused on quarterly earnings. Again, the rational course for these managers isn't long, risky, costly new ideas but steady returns.
>None of this leads to more dynamism. Firms invest much less, including on R&D, when they have institutional ownership and when a sector sees a great concentration of firms. When there are fewer but bigger companies, they are incentivised to return the money and don't worry as much about competition. No wonder we have a sclerotic and, ironically, closed economy. No wonder company net investment has declined. Corporate investment, much higher than noncorporate business investment, fell from 30–40 per cent in the period 1950–2000 to 20–25 per cent after 2000, and that ignores the dip after the financial crisis, to say nothing of the coronavirus recession.25 Cash is not spent on risky ventures but hoarded or returned to shareholders in record amounts. Measured as a proportion of internal cash flow, returns to shareholders are six times higher than the 1970s.26 S&P 500 companies alone have trillions in cash, splurging a record $800 billion on share buybacks, almost $500 billion on dividends, while Apple and Alphabet alone sit on hundreds of billions.27 All this epic hoarding of cash is described as ‘precautionary’.
>If capitalism used to be about owner-managers taking risks to create new breakthrough businesses, the interwoven, highly intermediated ‘gray’ structure of modern equity markets is the opposite. It's not that business doesn't have the money to radically change the world; it's that managers and institutional owners neither need nor are incentivised to do so. In other words, modern business practice stifles the very creative destruction that was meant to be the productive essence of capitalism.
