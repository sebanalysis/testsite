## Preface

A oral history, for something cultural like the transmission of values in a company, is much more effective that a set of written values because each transmission is also accompanied by some human trust and emotion which adds much needed authenticity. Oral history is also never remembered verbatim. With each transmission, it is rehashed and reformed and recalibrated to bring it closer to the truth. As different chains of Chinese whispers diverge and find conflicts when the re merge, there is an opportunity for improvement and adaptation of the ideas. 

As text is just a temporary abstraction from the real world, writing values down is useful as a way to capture a freeze frame of an ever evolving ever iterating and iterating story. Values are not cold facts, they are the demonstrated actions of individuals, borne out by their behavior. Treating the codified values as dogma is a recipe for stagnation and decline in civil virtue.


## Purpose of Business Values

The normal state of business is one ruled by nepotism. It is also motivated by short-term, empty profit-seeking or rent-seeking tasks that provide no added value, typically by exploiting the client's ignorance or poor regulatory calibration. The forces of human nature are dragging an organisation in this direction at every moment. But greatness lies in defying the odds to build something better. The purpose of values should therefore be to explicitly resist the natural pull towards degeneration.

> _“Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.”_ (Eric Hoffer, [The Temper of Our Time](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1210985), a collection of essays published in 1996)

As the organisation grows, resisting this becomes even more difficult and incentives become ever more disaligned and work politics eat into decision making efficacy.

> Any organization with a large, protected income will tend by default toward administrative bloat. It's the same in government, at Harvard, at Google. Unless you take explicit measures to avoid it, you'll overhire. And then you have a second problem: all the unnecessary people you've hired become a drag on the necessary ones. The unproductive people need to seem like they're achieving something, so they'll organize meetings to waste the time of the productive ones. If anyone has avoided administrative bloat, it might be DARPA. They seem to have a culture of explicitly avoiding the pitfalls of bureaucracy.

Bearing this in mind, the following is an attempt to summaries my key antidotes to the entropy.

My philosophy or management consists of 3 words: Transparency, simplification, the goal.

- Transparency: Wages, roles, tasks, responsibilities, motivations: everything will be open and obvious to all involved. There should be no pretense about the differing financial motivations and incentives of wage laborers and those with shares. 
- Simplification:  Remove requirements and processes that do not serve the goal. The more abstract, generally the more useless. People should never be paid to justify their own job. They should be incentivised to automate or remove the need for it and then be promoted as they now do the work of multiple people.
- The goal: The purpose of the business is to make money from delivering a product. I refuse to rent seek or justify it as 'operating under the fiduciary responsibility to shareholders'. This only moves humanity backward. What is required to motivate people is a constant awareness of the goal. We should work to constantly and iteratively redefine the goal. 

Work should be useful. Work is rewarding not when it is 'fun' but when you can see the underlying purpose of the enterprise and you are shouldering the load. It is possible to motivate people to show up and comply via pure financial incentives, but it is not possible to make them benefits the company by sacrificing the expedient for the correct.

I will never run a racket.

Logistical management of the office itself a priority: simplify all processes and interactions.
Any organizational fluff and documents will be ruthlessly removed at the earliest sign of their redundancy.
Relevant organization charts and abstract processes will be physically placed on the wall.
I will not micromanage. 
I will take ultimate ownership for everything.
I will instill the sense that I judge my employees based on the work they produce, not the time they spend.
Documents to avoid the passive voice wherever possible. It is not a sign of professionalism to remove the subject of a verb. 
Tick-boxing exercises to be avoided entirely. Where legally necessary, they will be acknowledged as such and excecuted with awareness.
Work will thus be divided into either real or tickbox, and the distinction will be acknowledged.
Everything that can be automated will be automated including HR. 
I cannot manage a large company, it is not my desire to do so. I have to know the entire vertical supply chain for it to function properly.
Everything to be viewed through the lens of how it enhances the company's real and tickbox labour efficiency. This is to be known as 'solving problems'. All focus to be placed on solving problems. 
Review relevance of regular ongoing meetings.
You need a physical office for new employees. Those with longer running relationships still need regular meet-ups.


### Attitude and Trust Ahead of Adherence and Dogma



## The archetypal dysfunctional work interaction

The archetypal dysfunctional work interaction occurs when establishing tasks, discussing solutions, requesting assistance, giving imperative commands and appraising work. 

You approach your colleague with the intention of resolving something. Their response does not answer the question, so you assume they have not understood it. You are forced to rudely interrupt and reverse in order to recalibrate to the point in question. Again your colleague introduces complexity without addressing the point. You assume that you must be lacking understanding of the problem. You assume that your colleague is charitably trying to explain the by adding the complexity as necessary context delivered in good faith in order to explain the point in question. Why would someone mention it if it were irrelevant.

You ultimately _need_ an answer so you declare this lack of understanding to your colleague and thus demote your reputation and establish him the authority in the relationship. You spend some time, maybe a week or a few days reading around the topics he advised. You waste time, you don't understand the text. The words are leaves blowing in the wind without a branch of knowledge to bind to. You eventually realize that the material doesn't address the question. You ask other people in the organization for direction but they all point you back to the original colleague. 

You are confused, you are frustrated. If you ask the original colleague again you will be directly challenging his newly established authority if you explicitly state that the material is not applicable. You decide to present the colleague with the material itself, and ask questions related to it. He brings up more material and more complexity. You are now more confused so you try something else. You go through the material and do a sort of live Q&A. You weave through focusing on granular facts and suggest a connection to the the main body of knowledge to try and guide him into forging a link. He fails to see the relevance at each timer and instead explains further extraneous points. You have further degraded your authority with each failure to find a link. 

Now you are more frustrated. You are effectively left with 2 options. 1. Call out your colleague directly for purposeful or ignorance obfuscation or 2. Try and move on to something else.

You are forced to choose option 2. You are not is a position to question authority. But there is only a certain number of times you can ignore fundamental questions before you loose faith in the whole enterprise and totally forsake your civil virtue. Inevitably, your trust collapses and you play work politics just to survive.
