# TYPES
## Flunkies 
Jobs that only serve to improve the reputation, image or perceived value. A product of vanity.
e.g. certain receptionists or P.A.s where there are no calls to take

## Goons 
Jobs that exist in adversarial situations because the competitor has them. Prisoners dilemma, destructive competitiveness, manufactured demand, excessive supply, con schemes, services and shit you don't need.
e.g. Armies, Corporate Lawyers,

## Duct tapers 
Jobs that exist to treat symptoms rather than the root cause of a problem. Shortsighted, temporary remediation. Lack of long term strategy. 
e.g. IT people who spend all their time repairing out of date systems, 

## Box tickers 
Jobs dominated by compliance or paperwork that exist only because the value in the paperwork, accreditation, or analysis is more important than actually doing the task itself. Allows an organisation to claim it is doing something that it is not doing. Value of third party accredited qualifications or approved documentation greater than personal trust. Ass covering, fear of liability, obsession with compliance over competence.
e.g. Bullshit corporate training, Consultancy Companies forcing meaningless charity events on employees purely to meet the criteria of Times top 100 employers list.

## Taskmasters 
Unnecessary levels of supervision They act as liability buffers or simply because upper management has a lack of trust in lower ranks and won't allow them to operate independently. 
e.g. Middle management, project managers, finance people
Examples in nucleargrads: 
- tediously long and formal emails -box ticking
- training courses that are twice as long as they need to be and deliver very little ostensible value. - duct taping and box ticking
- the appearance of doing work over inherent values. I.e. the ability to discuss the work in appraisal and have a substantial document to support it.


They should put us in a room and try to make us solve Sellafield. Come up with a plan. figure it out ourselves. give us access to loads of technical information

## Reasons

Rent seeking - exploitation of defined rules to accrue wealth but not deliver value. Striving to become gatekeepers who deliver no value but exists as a bureaucratic lynchpin.

Decadent listlessness - drives need to convince people they need to buy things they don't need or to do things that defy common sense

Loss of community, lack of trust and total reliance on litigation. Breakdown of real personal relationships due to corporate mobility, burgeoning organisations of strangers entirely reliant on processes, impersonal interactions. People never work where they grow up, and move jobs every few years.

Protectionism - maintaining copyright or intellectual property which prevents ability to collaborate and creates unnecessary red-tape around useful data. 

Short Term Thinking to meet immediate management or shareholder requirements - need for immediate profit moves investment away from solving the root cause of problems.

No workplace freedom suppression - A lot of bullshit in the workplace comes from the inability to speak your mind as  result of being constantly on the record. This means that truths are not communicated effectively. In order to humanize the office. Managers may use unnatural 'creativity' exercises to build false rapport.

Paying for someone's time rather than for the completion of a tasks or delivery of value. This is a perverse incentive. Too often, employees function as serfs, being paid to appear busy to their colleges and managers. Managers are often content to incubate their egos through the illusion their underlings are working, even if they are not doing anything useful.

Reality doesn't matter as much as legal compliance or the paper-trail. eg. Museum guard not allowed to read any novels while guarding an empty room. e
e.g. Girl who completed all exams and received good grades but emotionally was not capable of completing documentation to register these results. 

Personal experiences: security incident - being reported up each stage of the chain. I was punished because I believed the lies I was told in the security training session that 'there is no stupid question about security'.

It is for this reason that the commercial world feels exceptionally hollow. Our interactions are with institutions akin to a catholic church. An elaborate fa√ßade to keep up appearances, smiling faces, shiny expensive pamphlets with perfect ethnic and gender diversity, automated tannoy messages declaring how they are truly sorry they are for your delay, self declared 'polite notices'. At a deeper level, you find jobsworths who will obstiantly impose on you rules that they have no shame in denying any understanding of nor in professing a lack of any personal or professional compulsion to find out why they are imposing these rules.

A basic axiom of my world view, baked into me from parents and school, clearly from a by-gone age, is that work should have a purpose that benefits humanity. Institutions of existence and I find this society wide presence unbearable. Each failure of an individual to speak what he or she knows to be true for the sake of personal expediency is an incremental step towards tyranny.

At the core of our economy lies the truth that it is perceived value that matters, not actual value. All that matters to stock charts and projections and the betting market of investment is belief. Belief that something has value is the route to accruing confidence. It matters not whether that something has any actual value as determined by common sense.

# The counter-argument 

Shortly after Graeber released his essay, the economist published a rebuttal which argued that the purposeless feeling of the modern working world was an illusion. The incomprehensible these jobs was simply due to the inherent complexity of an advanced economy. That people simply cannot understand the utility of their role from their narrow, local perspective, but that, viewed holistically, they do function as a cog in a greater machine.
