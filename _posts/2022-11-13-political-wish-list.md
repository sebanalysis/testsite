Supporting a political party is like supporting a sports team. Even if you limited your concern to just 20 different political issues, each with 3 possible stances. That makes a [combinatronics](https://sebanalysis.github.io/2022/11/09/combinatronic-maths.html) [permutation with repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Permutations_with_repetition) problem, with $$20^3$$ i.e. $$8000$$ possible solutions. The likelihood of your alignment with any political party simultaneously on all of those issues is effectively $$0$$. So debating which team to support is only useful as far as you are deciding how to temporarily compromise when you are asked to vote. Lifetime political party affiliation is just an advertisement of your own intellectual failure.

### Moving dials 

I see each political issues not as binary decision, but as spectrum. They can be thought of as dials which can be too low or too high at any given moment in time. Your political position is actually defined by what you thing needs to happen to those dials at any given moment. Do we need free-speech or moderation, rights or responsibility, regulation or liberalisation? Each of these dials, have a difference response when applied to a different scope: location, time-frame, topic. 

- Prioritise market competition over wealth redistribution
- Prioritise actions over words
- Prioritise responsibility over rights
- Prioritise facts over feelings

The most important issue to me is to stop pursing the failed policy of redistribution of wealth through increased taxes and start demanding increased competition, efficiency and innovation. Remove the regulations that protect incumbent, monopolistic organizations from competition

Secondly, the entire political debate is occurring in an Overton window which priorities empathy over rationality.
